Minetest 5.4 mod: Ju52
========================================


While the machine is off, it is possible to move it using the sneak and jump keys (shift an space).
W ans S controls the pitch (elevator).
Right and Left (A and D) controls the yaw (rudder).

Then to fly, start the engine with the special key E. Press jump (space)
to increase the engine power. Set it to the maximum. Pull the elevator control (S)
when it have the speed to lift.

Use the climb indicator to stabilize altitude,
as at high altitudes you lose sustentation and you spend more fuel. 

For landing, just lower the power and stabilize the airplane. Pay attention at air speed
indicator, keeping it at green range, otherwise you will stall.

Care must be taken with impacts, as it causes damage to the aircraft and the pilot, 
so training landings is essential. 

To brake the aircraft, use the sneak (shift) key until it comes to a complete stop.
Do not stop the engine before this, or it will reverse when it stops
