Minetest 5.4 mod: Ju52
========================================

This mod is a version of the german ju52 for minetest.
It is under development, so it does not yet have an autopilot nor the planned automated
airline system for the future. But it is already flyable, and can carry up to 12 occupants.

The main functions of the aircraft are found in the internal menu, activated with the right click.
There is a second menu, for applying skins, but it only appears when hitting a dye on the aircraft,
being INSIDE it. For other colors, you can use a dye on the OUTSIDE with the desired color,
it is also possible to use the painter from the bike mod or from the automobiles_pck mod.

In order for passengers to board, it is necessary to open the door, otherwise no one will be able to enter.

While the machine is off, it is possible to move it using the sneak and jump keys (shift an space).
W ans S controls the pitch (elevator).
Right and Left (A and D) controls the yaw (rudder).

Then to fly, start the engine with the special key E. Press jump (space)
to increase the engine power. Set it to the maximum. Pull the elevator control (S)
when it have the speed to lift.

Use the climb indicator to stabilize altitude,
as at high altitudes you lose sustentation and you spend more fuel. 

For landing, just lower the power and stabilize the airplane. Pay attention at air speed
indicator, keeping it at green range, otherwise you will stall.

Care must be taken with impacts, as it causes damage to the aircraft and the pilot, 
so training landings is essential. 

To brake the aircraft, use the sneak (shift) key until it comes to a complete stop.
Do not stop the engine before this, or it will reverse when it stops
